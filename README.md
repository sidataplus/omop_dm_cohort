# Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus patients cohort

This cohort was originally built on Siriraj Hospital Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus patients data. This data was structured in OMOP CDM v5.4.

This cohort creation code is a work-in-progress as it still retains some local codes.

The final version will be applicable to every OMOP CDM v5.4 dataset.

### Procedure
- Constructing steps of this cohort can be read in doc/steps

### Code to run
- Run the code in notebook "inclusion.ipynb" and "exclusion.ipynb"
